# ansible-regexp

Example playbook playgound testing Ansible's regular expression filters per [Ansible's docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_filters.html?highlight=regex%20match#regular-expression-filters). This documentation is now very good, but at the time I wrote this test repo, it had many confusing errors.


Run: 

```
ansible-playbook -i ./ansible_hosts ./playbook.yml
```
